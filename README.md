## Instructions

## Score Format

A score is represented as one long string with notes separated by spaces. Notes
are a combination of a note value and a length, potentially with an up-or-down
octave notation. For example, `c8` means to play the note C as an 8th note. In
addition to music notes, drum values (like `h` for hi-hat) and rests (`r`) are
permitted. Really anything an instrument defines!
